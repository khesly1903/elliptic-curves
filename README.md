-ec_overR.py: Deals with operations on elliptic curves over the field of real numbers (unfinished).
-ec_overF.py: Deals with operations on elliptic curves over finite fields. However, it only handles finite fields of the form F_p, meaning it does not work with extension fields of the form F_p^n. The available operations are:
  1: Elliptic Curve points and graphs
  2: Addition
  3: Scalar multiplication
  4: Scalar multiplication using the double-and-add algorithm
  5: Order of an element and its graph
