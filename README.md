An $\textbf{elliptic curve}$ over a field $F$ of characteristic not equal to 2 or 3 is defined as a non-singular curve $E$ given by the equation:
        $E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$  
    where $x,y,a,b \in F$ and $\Delta = 4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$. Additionally, the point at infinity, denoted by $\mathcal{O}$ is included as part of the curve.  
    The elliptic curves of the above form are called $\textbf{(short) Weierstrass Form}$ elliptic curves. The codes for elliptic curves are use this form and finite fields $F_p$ but not $F_{p^n}$. You can use large primes to construct an elliptic curve but may experience a loss of performance with very large prime numbers. Here the operations:  
    1: Elliptic Curve points and graph  
    2: Addition  
    3: Scalar multiplication  
    4: Scalar multiplication with double and add algorithm  
    5: Order of an element and its graph
